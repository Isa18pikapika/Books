        <h1>How to get saved</h1>
        <p>In 1 John 5:13 we read "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; 
            that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God." This 
            is telling us that we are able to know for sure whether or not we are going to go to Heaven when we die. 
            From here, if we go to Romans 3:10 it tells us that "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:" 
            This means that no one is perfect. No matter how perfect someone thinks they are, they still have something 
            that makes them imperfect. So what is that something? 
        </p>
        <p>In Romans 3:23 we read "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;" So the thing that makes us 
            all imperfect is sin. Sin is anything we do wrong, from murder to a little white lie. In God's eyes, all sin 
            is sin. And because of our sin, we cannot reach God's glory on our own. Romans 5:12 tells us "Wherefore, as by 
            one man sin entered into the world,and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:" 
            Sin entered into the world by Adam and death entered into the world by sin. We are all born into sin. Take into 
            consideration a toddler. Would you have to teach the toddler to be bad or good? 
        </p>
        <p>It may seem like a silly example at first, but when you look closer, you know that you actually do have to teach 
            that toddler how to be good. In the first half of Romans 6:23 it says "For the wages of sin is death:" Wages is 
            what you earn. Revelation 21:8 tells us just exactly what that death is. "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and 
            the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters,and all liars, shall have their part
            in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."
        </p>
        <p>Everyone dies eventually physically eventually. But this passage tells us that there is also a second death for all
            sinners. Fire and brimstone for all eternity. Now back to Romans 6:23. "For the wages of sin is death;" Okay. We've 
            covered that, but look at the second half of the verse. "...but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ 
            our Lord." There is a way to escape that eternal death and have eternal life! But how to get the gift of eternal life?
        </p>
        <p>In Ephesians 2:8-9 we see "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 
            Not of works, lest any man should boast."
