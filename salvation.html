        <h1>How to get saved</h1>
        <p>
            In 1 John 5:13 we read "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; 
            that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God." This 
            is telling us that we are able to know for sure whether or not we are going to go to Heaven when we die. 
            From here, if we go to Romans 3:10 it tells us that "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:" 
            This means that no one is perfect. No matter how perfect someone thinks they are, they still have something 
            that makes them imperfect. So what is that something? 
        </p>
        <p>
            In Romans 3:23 we read "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;" So the thing that makes us 
            all imperfect is sin. Sin is anything we do wrong, from murder to a little white lie. In God's eyes, all sin 
            is sin. And because of our sin, we cannot reach God's glory on our own. Romans 5:12 tells us "Wherefore, as by 
            one man sin entered into the world,and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:" 
            Sin entered into the world by Adam and death entered into the world by sin. We are all born into sin. Take into 
            consideration a toddler. Would you have to teach the toddler to be bad or good? 
        </p>
        <p>
            It may seem like a silly example at first, but when you look closer, you know that you actually do have to teach 
            that toddler how to be good. In the first half of Romans 6:23 it says "For the wages of sin is death:" Wages is 
            what you earn. Revelation 21:8 tells us just exactly what that death is. "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and 
            the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters,and all liars, shall have their part
            in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."
        </p>
        <p>
            Everyone dies eventually physically. But this passage tells us that there is also a second death for all
            sinners. Fire and brimstone for all eternity. Now back to Romans 6:23. "For the wages of sin is death;" Okay. We've 
            covered that, but look at the second half of the verse. "...but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ 
            our Lord." There is a way to escape that eternal death and have eternal life! But how to get the gift of eternal life?
        </p>
        <p>
            In Ephesians 2:8-9 we see "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 
            Not of works, lest any man should boast." If you'll allow me to break this down, we see five key parts. Firstly, we 
            see that by grace we are saved, through our faith in God. Second, we see that it is not of ourselves. We on our own 
            have no power to escape dying and going to hell. Thirdly, it is the gift of God. Fourthly, we can't be saved of our 
            own works. Lastly, lest any man should boast. So put these five together and we have a conclusion like this. We are 
            saved by grace, through our faith in God, who gives us a gift of being able to make that choice to trust in Him. 
            We are not able to save ourselves from hell because being saved doesn't come from works we do, otherwise we would 
            all be boastful about how good we are. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Galatians 2:16 says "Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ,
            even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of 
            the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified." According to this passage, we can only be justified
            through our faith in Jesus. This means that even if you think you are a good person, you can't work your way to Heaven. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, we will look at Romans 5 verses 8-10. "But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners,
            Christ died for us. Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. For if,
            when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved 
            by his life." God proved His love for us by sending Jesus to die on the cross even when he knew we were all going to be 
            sinners. God sent Jesus to provide a way for us to escape the punishment for sin. We are justified by Jesus' blood.
        </p>
        <p>
            Romans 6:9 tells us "Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him."
            Jesus was raised from the dead after He died on the cross for our sins. He conquered death itself! And because of this, 
            when we trust in Him, and believe that He died for our sins, we can conquer death too! We will die physically, but if we 
            have faith in Jesus, and that He died and rose again for our sins, we can escape the second death, and have eternal life 
            with God. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, we will turn to Romans 10 and read verses 9-13. "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus,
            and shalt believe in thine heart, that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man 
            believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scriptue saith, Whosoever 
            believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over 
            all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."

            I'd like you to really think about this. Whosever. That means whoever. Me, you, your next door neighbor. Try putting your 
            name there. The last passage tells us that those who believe on God shall not be ashamed. There is no reason to be scared someone 
            will judge you for your choice. So here are a few questions for you to think about. Answer them out loud to yourself. Ask yourself 
            if you truly believe.
